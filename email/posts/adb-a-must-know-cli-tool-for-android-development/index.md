<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb"><code>adb</code></a> is a CLI that
lets you control your Android device from your computer. In this post I want to
share its features that made me enjoy more mobile development.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h1>
  Initial Setup
</h1>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to connect your device to your computer, either <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling">through
USB</a> or <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi-android-11+">purely
via
Wi-Fi</a>
(<em>if you&rsquo;re on Android 11+</em>), but it&rsquo;s also possible to use <code>adb</code> over Wi-Fi on
Android 10 or lower if you follow some <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless">initial
steps</a> while
connected over USB.</p>
<p>If everything works correctly, by running <code>adb devices</code> you should see
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">$ adb devices

List of devices attached
emulator-5554	device
0035714150	device
</code></pre></div><h1>
  Record screen with <code>adb shell screenrecord</code>
</h1>
<p>To record your screen, it&rsquo;s as simple as running <code>adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/video.mp4</code>. After you&rsquo;re done, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
Run <code>adb pull /sdcard/video.mp4 ~/Videos/video.mp4</code> to get the video into your
computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also useful to know some of the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#screenrecord">command line
options</a>,
my favorite ones being to limit the video size with <code>--size</code> and recording time
with <code>--time-limit</code>.</p>
<p>For example, I typically run <code>adb shell screenrecord --size 320x568 --time-limit=120 /sdcard/video.mp4</code>.</p>
<h1>
  Capture screen with <code>adb shell screencap</code>
</h1>
<p>This is straightforward, it just captures the screen with <code>adb shell screencap /sdcard/img.png</code>, then getit locally with <code>adb pull /sdcard/img.png ~/Images/img.png</code>.</p>
<h1>
  Debugging with <code>adb logcat</code>
</h1>
<p>This has proved useful to me so many times. In the context of React Native
development, this is usually less useful in debug builds. But in release builds
it&rsquo;s sometimes the only way to debug when something wrong happens.</p>
<p>For example, when an app crashes or some SDK call is not working, you&rsquo;ll
probably be able to see why with <code>adb logcat</code>.</p>
<p>The downside is that the output can be overwhelming, since it&rsquo;s a huge wall of
text that is growing constantly. So it pays off to know how to filter it, e.g.
if I wanted to see only logs tagged with <code>Sentry</code>, <code>ReactNative</code> and
<code>ReactNativeJS</code> at any priority level:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">adb logcat Sentry:* ReactNative:* ReactNativeJS:* *:S
</code></pre></div><p>The official Google
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat#filteringOutput">documentation</a>
explains nicely how this works.</p>
<h1>
  Networking with <code>adb reverse</code>
</h1>
<p>Imagine you want to see your <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> files in a
mobile web browser. If you go to <code>localhost:6006</code> in your computer&rsquo;s browser,
it works, but nothing shows up in your mobile device&rsquo;s browser, since no
process is bound to port <code>6060</code> there.</p>
<p>You can solve this problem by running <code>adb reverse tcp:6006 tcp:6006</code>. Now your
mobile device will have access to the server running on your computer.</p>
<p>An example from React Native is the Metro bundler, that usually serves the
bundled JS of your app at port <code>8081</code>, so we need to run <code>adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081</code> to make the server reachable by the Android device. This is usually
done under the hood when we run <code>npx react-native run-android</code>, but if the
device can&rsquo;t find the JS bundle or is stuck loading it we usually need to run
it again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also <code>adb forward</code>, in case you need to make a web server running on
your phone also available to your computer.</p>
<h1>
  Start/kill apps
</h1>
<p>You can start and kill an app with the <code>adb shell am</code>, in which <code>am</code> stands for
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am"><em>Activity Manager</em></a>.</p>
<p>Given the app&rsquo;s package name, you can start it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">adb shell am start -n com.company.app/.MainActivity
</code></pre></div><p>And kill it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">adb shell am force-stop com.company.app
</code></pre></div><p>You can also open a URL, this is specially useful to test deep links:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d company://Screen
</code></pre></div><h1>
  Install/uninstall apps
</h1>
<p>You can install an <code>.apk</code> file with <code>adb install app.apk</code>.</p>
<p>And uninstall it with <code>adb uninstall com.company.app</code>.</p>
<p>This is usually how I do it, but there&rsquo;s also the <code>pm</code> command, which stands
for <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#pm">Package
Manager</a>, that is a
more powerful interface to manage apps. Apart from enabling you to install and
uninstall apps, you can also clear data, grant/revoke permissions etc.</p>
